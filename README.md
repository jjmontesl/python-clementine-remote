Python Clementine Remote
========================

**Python library and command line tool for the Clementine Music Player remote protocol.**

It allows you to connect to Clementine through its network protocol
and control the media player.

Clementine remote protocol provides functionality including:

* Play / Pause / Stop / Next / Previous actions
* Continuous track position information
* Volume control
* Song metadata, album art
* Playlist management
* Other: lyrics, download (not yet implemented)

Note that you need to configure your Clementine Player to accept network connections.

Usage
=====


Usage from Python
-----------------

Import the Clementine class:

    >>> from clementineremote import ClementineRemote

Create an instance (by default this will connect to localhost:5500):

    >>> clementine = ClementineRemote(auth_code=1234)

Alternatiuvely, you can create a instance that will try to reconnect automatically:

    >>> clementine = ClementineRemote(host="127.0.0.1", reconnect=True)

Use the `host` and `port` arguments to specify a particular host:

    >>> clementine = ClementineRemote(host="127.0.0.1", port=5500, auth_code=None)

You can query the player status. Note that **some attributes will be None until information is received**,
also, calls issued before the connection is established will silently fail.

    >>> clementine.first_data_sent_complete
    True
    >>> clementine.current_track['title']
    'Born Slippy (Underworld)'

You can access several song metadata:

    >>> clementine.current_track.keys()
    dict_keys(['playcount', 'art', 'track', 'title', 'year', 'pretty_length', 'filename', 'length', 'track_artist', 'type', 'track_index', 'is_local', 'track_id', 'rating', 'track_album', 'file_size', 'genre'])

Position is continuously updated (it's reported in seconds):

    >>> clementine.track_position
    443
    >>> clementine.track_position
    444

Do not forget to disconnect. The client creates a thread to handle incoming messages,
disconnecting terminates the extra thread:

    >>> clementine.disconnect()

      -r, --reconnect       try to reconnect
      --version             show program's version number and exit


Listening to events
-------------------

Note that event handling code executes in a different thread from which the client instance
is initialized. This may require you to synchronize access to your your shared variables.


Configuring Clementine to allow remote connections
--------------------------------------------------

Remember that Clementine must be configured to accept connections through its
network remote control protocol.

You can configure this through Clementine  `Tools > Preferences > Network remote control`
configuration menu. Enable `Use network remote control` and configure the other options
for your use case.
